# Half Life Alyx: Portal Gun
Archive of my WIP portal gun mod for Half Life Alyx.
When in college for physics, I was playing modded Half Life Alyx and wanted to create the Portal Gun so I could use it in Portal/2 maps that have been ripped and put into the game (had ripped some myself, wasn't hard).

As finals were starting to come up, I was unable to get this to a state I was happy with. I was going to continue work on it, but the code has since been lost due to a corrupted Windows install : (

This is to give me a refresher when I get back into it.

Written using the HLA API scripting documentation. I had to reuse projection cameras and assign them as textures to get around some of the limitations I had with the scripting API at the time.

The rest of the images are random bits of math and code for the trig related to view projections. I have to look through more of my archives for other progress and updates I made on it.
